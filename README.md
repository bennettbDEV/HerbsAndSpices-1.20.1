As a programmer and a huge fan of countless Minecraft mods, I figured it's about time I make my own mod. 
<br /> <br /> 

Farming is a relaxing and satisfying part of Minecraft, but I wanted to change things up a bit and add harsh consequences 
for the crops I add. 
<br />

<h3>Some basic things to know </h3>
- Kemp seeds can be obtained by breaking grass - with a small chance that the seeds actually drop
- Silver Speedberry naturally generates in the world and can be found in the plains biome
- Idonite generates naturally and can be found at any y-level under 40


### Built With

* <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/">Forge</a>


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Setup

(Note that I will publish the mod to CurseForge upon reaching version 1.0)
<br />
For now, you can install and use the mod by following these steps:

- Download balefulherbs-0.X-1.20.1.jar from the root directory of this project
- (Option 1) If you don't have Forge 1.20.1 installed already check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEyGJSE0XD8">this guide</a>
  - Then navigate to your mods folder and place the downloaded jar file within it
- (Option 2) You can also add the jar file to an existing modpack using a modloader such as Curseforge
  - Open/Create a 1.20.1 modpack in CurseForge select it
  - Click on the three dots next to "Play"
  - Click on "Open Folder" <a><img src="readme_images/cf_guide_1.png" alt="showcase"></a>
  - The folder will open and from there you can drop the balefulherbs-0.X-1.20.1.jar file into the mods folder <a><img src="readme_images/cf_guide_2.png" alt="showcase"></a>

While developing this mod, I initially followed videos by Kaupenjoe to learn the basics of modding with Forge. Many simple parts of this mod
were made from those videos, so I urge you to check them out.
