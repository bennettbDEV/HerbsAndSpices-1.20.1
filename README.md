As a programmer and a huge fan of countless Minecraft mods, I figured it's about time I make my own mod. 
<br /> <br /> 

Farming is a relaxing and satisfying part of Minecraft, but I wanted to change things up a bit and add harsh consequences 
for the crops I add. 
<br />
... More info will be added soon ...


### Built With

While developing this mod, I initially followed videos by Kaupenjoe to learn the basics of modding with Forge. Many simple parts of this mod
were made from those videos, so I urge you to check them out.
